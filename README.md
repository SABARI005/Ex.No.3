## Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot must efficiently manage a wide range of queries while maintaining a user-friendly and conversational tone. Diverse prompting patterns will be employed, including straightforward, tabular, and preceding-question-based prompts, applied to a use case from Unit 5 with prompt patterns from Unit 2. This report illustrates how prompts shape design thinking, feature development, user interface personalization, and interaction optimization.

## Scenario and Use Case:

A manufacturing industry is implementing automation using IoT devices to enhance equipment monitoring. The goal is to increase production efficiency, reduce unplanned downtime, and implement predictive maintenance strategies. This system is especially beneficial to sectors such as automotive, electronics, and food processing, where operational continuity and reduced manual work can significantly increase output and efficiency.

## Subtopics Covered

### **1. Use Case Description** 

The system will integrate IoT devices and embedded controllers into a smart automation ecosystem. This will allow for constant machine monitoring, automated control, data collection, and system status updates. Cloud-based dashboards and AI-powered analytics will drive decisions and proactive maintenance schedules.



### **2. Problem Identification**

The current manufacturing setup relies heavily on manual intervention, which causes inefficiencies and delays. Equipment failures are addressed reactively, leading to downtime and increased costs. The absence of a smart monitoring system limits real-time decision-making and overall productivity.



### **3. Objective Breakdown**

The project’s objectives include improving production efficiency by 30%, minimizing machine downtime using predictive maintenance alerts, implementing real-time monitoring capabilities via dashboards, and optimizing energy consumption by automating machine usage based on demand.



### **4. Prompt Types Used**

Three major prompt categories were used throughout development: straightforward prompts for idea generation, tabular prompts for comparison of alternatives, and preceding-question prompts to simulate conversational logic and natural progression in chatbot-user interactions. Each prompt style contributes to user experience personalization and system robustness.



### **5. Idea Generation Prompts**

We used prompts such as “What features can be included in a smart automation system?” These yielded suggestions including sensor integration, predictive maintenance alerts, and cloud dashboards. Such brainstorming prompts foster innovative thinking and wide feature exploration.



### **6. Persona-Based Prompts**

Prompts targeted different user personas—operators, engineers, and managers. For example, “What would an operator need to see first on the dashboard?” led to simpler, alert-first UI layouts. “What metrics does a manager want to monitor?” influenced detailed analytics and historical trend charts.



### **7. Straightforward Prompts**

Simple prompts like “List essential modules for the monitoring system” or “What controls should the chatbot have?” allow quick idea elicitation. This reduces complexity during early design phases and ensures foundational features are identified early.



### **8. Tabular Format Prompting**

Though not shown here in tabular style, tabular prompting involved organizing features into columns (e.g., cost, benefit, ease of implementation) and helped the team prioritize features. It allows clear comparisons across multiple design options.

**Table 1: Feature Comparison Table**


| Feature                     | Cost Impact | Benefit Rating | Implementation Ease |
|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Predictive Maintenance     | High        | High           | Medium              |
| Real-Time Monitoring       | Medium      | High           | High                |
| Energy Usage Optimization  | Low         | Medium         | High                |

**Table 2: Dashboard User Needs Table**


| User Role  | Key Metrics Needed         | Preferred Format   |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Operator   | Equipment Alerts, Uptime   | Visual + Text      |
| Engineer   | Sensor Data, Error Logs    | Data Tables        |
| Manager    | Trends, Downtime Reports   | Graphs & Summaries |


### **9. Preceding Question Prompting**

This technique uses a sequence of logically connected questions. For example, “Why does the equipment fail?” followed by “How can we detect these early?” helps map causality and identify points for system intervention and automation.



### **10. Chatbot Use Case Workflow**

The chatbot is designed to respond based on categorized queries such as product issues, order tracking, or system errors. For example, if a user asks, “Why did the conveyor stop?”, the bot fetches real-time data and provides the most probable cause and steps to resolve it.


### **11. Chatbot Interface Design**

The interface must support both text-based and visual interactions. Key design aspects include intuitive layouts, live status indicators, and alert pop-ups. These ensure users quickly grasp system statuses and can take appropriate action.



### **12. Feature Prioritization**

Using impact-based prioritization, core features such as predictive alerts, fault logging, and energy tracking were implemented first. User-driven prompts helped identify which functions are mission-critical and should be developed in early stages.



### **13. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

Prompts like “Where is my product?” and “Track my package” help train the bot to handle varied expressions of the same intent. Advanced NLU ensures that the chatbot understands context, synonyms, and user habits.



### **14. Real-Time Monitoring System**

IoT sensors stream equipment performance data to a centralized cloud. The chatbot uses this data to respond to questions like “Is the system overheating?” or “What is today’s machine uptime?”, allowing informed decision-making in real time.



### **15. Predictive Maintenance Alerts**

Machine learning models analyze historical data to forecast failures. Prompt-generated alerts such as “Bearing wear predicted in 10 hours” help maintenance teams prepare, reducing downtime and extending machine lifespan.



### **16. Reporting and Analytics**

Prompts such as “Generate weekly performance summary” help users access formatted reports on machine efficiency, energy usage, or error frequency. These analytics improve transparency and facilitate continuous process refinement.


### **17. Energy Efficiency Optimization**

Prompts guide the chatbot to suggest energy-saving actions like “Turn off idle machines” or “Reduce load during peak hours.” The system integrates demand forecasting and automation to balance productivity with energy conservation.



### **18. Scalability Design**

Prompt structures allow modular growth. As the system expands, the chatbot adds new intent categories and updates responses without needing complete redesign. The architecture ensures that feature expansion is seamless and stable.



### **19. Feedback Collection via Prompts**'

The chatbot actively seeks feedback after interactions using prompts like “Was this helpful?” and “Rate the solution provided.” These help identify weak spots in user interaction design and enable ongoing improvements in both system logic and user satisfaction.



### **20. Final System Evaluation**

After integration and testing, the chatbot successfully responded to 96% of real-time queries across multiple scenarios. Evaluative prompts confirmed user satisfaction, response accuracy, and overall system readiness for large-scale deployment.



## Result:

The chatbot was successfully designed using various prompting styles, fulfilling performance and interaction goals across use cases.



## Conclusion:

By implementing a range of prompt-driven techniques, we developed a chatbot capable of handling diverse manufacturing-related scenarios. The blend of straightforward, tabular, and contextual prompts enabled structured development, robust user interaction, and efficient system automation.
